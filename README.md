# hello-world
Just another repository 

This is my first github file. 
I am Chuck Chan from SZ. It is now 16:40p.m., April 15, 2018 and I have been learning Python and Developing for 3 months. After fininshed learning Django and HTML and JS, a blurry frame of web developing is taking shape in my head. 
My aim, for now, is to be a backend developer. Then as experience getting, I hope to become a data analyst in about 3 years.
Hope I would success!
